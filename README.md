# PING PONG PROJECT
#### Project to display ping, pong and pingpong from user input. 1/July/2018
#### By **Okello-Ojok Emmanuel**

## Description
This project shows Javascript loops and arrays in action. It takes user input from an HTML form which is a number and returns them. As it loops through, there are three exceptions (number divisble by 3 returns ping, number divisble by 5 returns pong and number divisble by 15 returns pingpong).  The iteration starts from 1 to the number the user entered.

##Specs
1. If the number is divisible by 3, a string ping is returned instead of the number.
    * Example input: 3
    * Example output: ping
2. If the number is divisible by 5, a string pong is returned instead of the number.
    * Example input: 5
    * Example output: pong
3. If the number is divisible by 15, a string pingpong is returned instead of the number.
    * Example input: 15
    * Example output: pingpong
4. If all the conditions are not met that is, number is not divisible by any of 3, 5,and 15, that particular number is returned.
    * Example input: 2
    * Example output: pingpong
